= Pulse

Pulse adds an action to your rails project that can be used for external health checking.  The most common use is by a http proxy such as haproxy[http://haproxy.1wt.eu/].  A proxy can be configured to hit your servers at a specified URL to see if the servers are healty.  By default, they use the "/" URL, but in many sites, this can have side effects like creating a session.  Pulse adds a "/pulse" URL which has no session and no logging.

== Installation

Pulse can be installed in 2 ways:

1. Installed gem
2. Unpacked gem in vendor folder

1. Installed gem

Just run:

sudo gem install pulse

And then add the following line to config/environment.rb

require 'pulse'


2. Unpacked gem in vendor folder

Download gem and unzip to vendor folder.

Add the following lines to config/environment.rb

$LOAD_PATH << File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../vendor/pulse-0.1.0/lib'
require 'pulse'


== Configuration of haproxy

Haproxy can be configured to use the /pulse url for its health checking.  Just add:

  option httpchk /pulse

So the server monitoring section will look something like:

listen rails :3001
  option httpchk /pulse
  server rails-1 localhost:3002 maxconn 1 check
  server rails-2 localhost:3003 maxconn 1 check
  server rails-3 localhost:3004 maxconn 1 check
  server rails-4 localhost:3005 maxconn 1 check

Now, all of the servers will be tested for health by hitting /pulse (eg http://localhost:3004/pulse)
